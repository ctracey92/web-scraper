3. **NOTE**: If you want to earn complete credit for your work, you must use all five of these packages in your assignment.

4. In order to deploy your project to Heroku, you must set up an mLab provision. mLab is remote MongoDB database that Heroku supports natively. Follow these steps to get it running:

5. Create a Heroku app in your project directory.

6. Run this command in your Terminal/Bash window:

* `heroku addons:create mongolab`

* This command will add the free mLab provision to your project.

7. When you go to connect your mongo database to mongoose, do so the following way:

```js
// If deployed, use the deployed database. Otherwise use the local mongoHeadlines database
var MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI || "mongodb://localhost/mongoHeadlines";

mongoose.connect(MONGODB_URI);
```

* This code should connect mongoose to your remote mongolab database if deployed, but otherwise will connect to the local mongoHeadlines database on your computer.

9. Your site doesn't need to match the demo's style, but feel free to attempt something similar if you'd like. Otherwise, just be creative!
