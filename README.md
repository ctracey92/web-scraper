    Javascript, Node, Monogo, Jquery, Mongoose, Bootstrap, Ajax, Axios, Cheerio, Handlebars

* About 
    A web scraper that grabs articles and displays them to the page, it allows users to comment on the articles. 

* Objective 
    - To create a functioning node app that uses a mongo database.
    - Demonstrate the mastery of the Cheerio/Mongoose.

* Approach 
    - The challenge was getting the routes to synch with the Handlebars
    - I started off by working to get the routes working and displaying as JSON
    - Next I scoured through the docs to get the syntax correct for the Handlebars/Mongoose to work correctly
    - Still working on getting the page to refresh appropriately
